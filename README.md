## 📝 Assignment Objectives

This assignment focuses on two key image processing techniques:

### 🔹 Task 1: Otsu’s Thresholding on Noisy Image
- Create a synthetic grayscale image containing **two distinct objects** and a **background**, i.e., **3 pixel intensity levels**.
- Add **Gaussian noise** to the image.
- Apply **Otsu’s thresholding algorithm** to separate objects from the background.

### 🔹 Task 2: Region Growing Segmentation
- Implement the **region growing** technique to segment an object from a grayscale image.
- Select a **seed point** manually and grow a region by adding neighboring pixels that fall within a **thresholded intensity range**.
